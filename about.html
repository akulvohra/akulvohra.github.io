	<br>
	<p> Hello, my nams is Akul Vohra and I am currently a sophomore at Santa Clara High School. I have a passion for programming, specifically in  the field of artificial intelligence and deep learning. <br><br> I believe that AI can change the world, which is why I work on various personal projects within the field. <br><br> I am also a hobbyist web developer usually usually using Flask. I work on projects surrounding my passions and often post them on my Github account and my Projects page.<br><br> Other than programming, I am the captain of FIRST Tech Challenge robotics team 13219 X-cavators. I play tennis for my school and am also a Boy Scout in Troop 394. <br><br> For fun, I enjoy playing video games and love to follow the tech world. </p>
