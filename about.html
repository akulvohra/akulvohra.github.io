	<br>
	<p> Hello, my name is Akul Vohra and I am currently a sophomore at Santa Clara High School. I have a passion for programming, specifically in the field of artificial intelligence and deep learning. <br><br> I believe that AI can change the world, which is why I work on various personal projects within the field. <br><br>I work on projects surrounding my passions and often post them on my Github account and my Projects page. I am also director of operations for BruinHacks, a high school hackathon.<br><br> Other than programming, I am the captain of FIRST Tech Challenge robotics team 13219 X-cavators. I play tennis for my school and am also a Boy Scout in Troop 394. <br><br> For fun, I enjoy playing video games and love to follow the tech world. <br><br> This website was created to give a general overview about me and the projects I've worked on.</p>
