The goal of the project was to address a lack of interactive history apps on the market. In this application, students can walk through different ancient civilizations in 3D on their computer. Along the way, they will be stopped by markers in which a virtual tour guide will give information about a landmark or an aspect of daily life. This project won for the Top Ten category at TinoHacks. </p>
