	<br>
	<p> Here are a handful of projects I've worked on: </p>
	<br>
	<u><a href="https://dyspute.com"><p id ='big'>Dyspute</p></a></u>
	<p>(October 2018 - Present)</p>
	
	<p>Dyspute is a webapp aimed at connecting users to people who have different opinions than themselves with the goal of creating empathy between them.
	<br>
	The project is currently in beta and will be coming out soon at <a href='https://dyspute.com'>https://dyspute.com</a></p>

	<br>
	<u><a href="https://github.com/akulvohra/Sentwiment"><p id ='big'>Sentwiment</p></a></u>
	<p>(Made for HSHacks 2018)</p>
	
	<p>Sentwiment is a natural language processing project I worked on as an introduction to the topic. The model analyzes tweets from Twitters API for polarity and subjectivity and generates a JSON file of the values.
	<br>
	Source code for my project can be found at <a href='https://github.com/akulvohra/Sentwiment'>https://github.com/akulvohra/Sentwiment</a></p>

	<br>
	<u><a href="https://github.com/akulvohra/HistoricalTours"><p id ='big'>Historical Tours</p></a></u>
	<p>(Made for TinoHacks 2018)</p>
	
	<p>Historical Tours is a fun educational project I made. The idea was to allow students to experience history through a virtual tour. A tour guide would navigate users through a historical city while giving information and fun facts.
	<br>
	Source code for this project can be found at <a href='https://github.com/akulvohra/HistoricalTours'>https://github.com/akulvohra/HistoricalTours</a></p>

	<br>
	<u><a href="https://devpost.com/software/solve-nxil1y"><p id ='big'>Solve.</p></a></u>
	<p>(Made for WilHacks 2017)</p>
	
	<p>Solve. is a math based puzzle game filled with colorful rectangles. Students are encouraged to apply math operations such as fraction operations, and variables to "solve the puzzle."
	<br>
